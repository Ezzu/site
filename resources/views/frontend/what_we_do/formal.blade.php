        <div class="mt-3 p text-justify">The formation of formal education wing is based upon establishing, Jhuggi (tant) schools in the areas on the outskirts of the big cities where innumerable Gypsy Tribes dwell in the Jhuggies (tents made of rags). The living condition in these areas is worse than the urban slums and the Gypsy Children live here in pathetic conditions. In the absence of water, electricity and security they are forced to work for supplementing their family income. They are mostly involved in Rag Picking, begging, disposing-off the daily waste from the streets of the cities for nominal pays.</div>
        <div class="mt-3 p text-justify">We establish formal &ldquo;Aabroo Welfare Schools&rdquo; either in self-owned or rented buildings. All <b>Aabroo Schools</b> provide formal higher Secondary School level education for the day scholars and strictly follow the syllabi designed by the Text Book Boards of the provincial governments. All &ldquo;Aabroo Welfare Schools&rdquo; are registered with Education Departments of the respective provincial governments and affiliated with the Boards of Intermediate & Secondary Education in their geographical locations.</div>

        <div class="mt-3 p text-justify">Sustainability of Aabroo Educational Welfare Organization is the most serious consideration given  the   present  scenario   of   its educational   undertakings,  especially   in   the  view   of the success of the Aabroo model and the results achieved so far that require initiation of a Higher Secondary School (Intermediate College) for the students successfully passing out from the Secondary School Examination.</div>
        <div class="mt-3 p text-justify">The governance of Aabroo very strongly believes that dependence on donations from benefactors is not a long-term solution and has been discussing this topic for the last six months.</div>
        <div class="mt-3 p text-justify">It was resolved that, a three membered Endowment Committee be constituted with the task to devise rules, regulations and Dos & Don&rsquo;ts for the said fund, in line with the teachings of Quran.  The fund shall be launched as soon as its rules are approved and is registered with the concerned authority.</div>
